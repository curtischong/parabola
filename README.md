Using two stereoscopic cameras, OpenCV, and a C++ server serving socket connections to an ios app connected to the same local network, we wrote blazing fast code to identify the location of an orange cone and pinpoint it’s landing location. My favourite part was drawing hearts then freezing the frame to stand within them.

This was one of the more meaningful projects in my career as it involved accreditation to use my school’s machine shop, calibrating cameras and intense involvement with hardware. Never had I handled Arduinos, calibration markers, and all of the lighting/tinting problems I faced with image recognition. It was a great time and was one of the highlights of my first term at Waterloo!
